#### Hi, I'm Pengfei. I am currently studying Computer Science and Physics under a Double Degree Programme at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and I will be graduating in 2023. I have also taught hundreds of Computer Science students as a Teaching Assistant at the NUS School of Computing on the side. During the summer breaks, I have interned at Endowus (fintech startup) and Goldman Sachs (leading multinational investment bank), and I will be interning at Citadel (leading multinational hedge fund) this summer. I am very interested in algorithmic problem solving as well as performant software development. Please feel free to contact me via Email.
